This report shows sales trend in the year 2019.
To get an accurate report using Power BI, I did some data cleaning with Power Query which are column splitting with delimeter,
created the date table using DAX and also a table named Time Intelligence showing Month to Date sales, Quarter to date sales and Year to date sales.
Also created a table hosting the KPIs name Key Measures.
Using the data, I am able to show; 
Sales trend, Top -selling products,Revenue metrics for business decision making.
The Line Chart shows the sales made every month which let us know that the highest sales was made in December.
The Treemap shows the Top 5 products by Sales Count with Iphone having the highest sales count.
We also have two charts showing the weekly sales distribution and top 5 best selling products.
And also a map showing the Top 5 Cities with the highest sales.
We also have slicers showing calendar and list of products sold by the company.
